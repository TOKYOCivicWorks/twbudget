# How to Contribute

Thanks for taking the time to contribute.
This is just a simple guideline for contributing by coding software.

## Submit a Pull Request

1. Please create an issue, or choose an issue from issues.
2. Please create a branch for your change, e.g. feature/awesome-func,
fix/display-issue.
3. Please add the issue number when you submit a pull request.
4. Before merging, you should undergo code review by other developers.

## Make an Issue

Please describe these common sections. Just use what you need.

* Purpose
* Problem
* Approach (Solution)
* Changes
* Pros (Pros and Cons)
* Screenshots
* How to Reproduce
* Tasks

Please make sure to attach some labels, e.g. enhancement, bug, to each issue.

## Code Review

* Please let other developers check your code during pull request.
* Normally, please keep two or more reviewers.
* Common case: the 1st reviewer sends '+1', the 2nd reviewer sends
  'Approve', and the author merges the change.
* Please be careful to make your review comment not time-consuming for
  reviewees but necessary, effective and useful for the software.
* The reasonable size of one change is usually 100 to 200 lines. 1000 lines is
  too large, but itâ€™s up to the case and the judgment of your reviewer
  ([ref](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html)).
* To know more details, please refer to [Google's code review developer
  guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/).

## Other Guidelines

* If you can use English, English will be better than Japanese (this is not a
must rule).
* As much as you can, please follow Google coding style
  ([JS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html),
  [AngularJS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/angularjs-google-style.html) /
  [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide),
  [Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), etc.) in order to
  reduce software management cost by keeping consistency and by improving
  readability.

Thanks to all contributors for your support and kindness.
